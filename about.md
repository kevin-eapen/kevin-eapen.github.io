I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2018 with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. Iâ€™m most passionate about exploring areas where creativity, disruptive technology, and data-driven business meet. Outside of data, my interests include music production and guitar.

### More Information

Most recently, I have been very interested in data focused projects in music, including leveraging neural networks models to create song lyrics.
